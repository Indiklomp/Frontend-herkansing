            your-secondhand is a project by Linde Helene. A girl who would love to help earth become a little more
            sustainable again.
            And therefore she needs your help. Shop at your-secondhand to rise against the Fast Fashion industry.
            Do you want to know some facts about the Fast Fashion industry, and understand why we're creating a counter
            movement and rise up against the Fast Fashion industry?

            You've probably heard about it before, the people who are making fast fashion items work under very bad
            conditions. They get verbally abused and beaten, work long (over) hours and earn only a little money.
            That's horrific right! And these facts are not even the only bad things about it.
            Did you know that the fast fashion industry is responsible for 20% of the worldwide wastewater? That is
            shockingly much. You should also know that the co2 emission that the fast fashion industry emits is bigger
            than the co2 emission of airplanes. These are terrible facts. By telling you these facts I want to create an
            awareness for (against) the fast fashion industry.
            I hope that now you know a little more about the Fast Fashion industry, you'll stop shopping at stores such
            as H&M, Zara, Forever 21, Primark, Monki etc. Instead of that, search for sustainable/ slow fashion brands,
            or shop secondhand clothes/ go thrifting. Of course it would be nice if you'd go shopping at your-secondhand
            but what we find more important is that you skip the fast fashion brands and go for a more sustainable way.
            ðŸŒ¿
            IN SHORT:
            - Very bad working conditions
            - Responsible for 20% of worldwide wastewater
            - Larger co2 emission than airplanes
